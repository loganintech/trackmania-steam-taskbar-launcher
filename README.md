When launching Trackmania through steam, it launches properly (with the overlay and such).

However if you pin that launched item to your taskbar it launches through Uplay directly.

This is a compiled AutoHotkey script that will call `steam://rungameid/2225070` for you. But since it's an EXE itself you can pin it to your taskbar.
